# 第二十二章-超越物理内存策略

## Problem1

### 问题描述

使用以下参数生成随机地址：-s 0 -n 10,-s 1 -n 10 和-s 2 -n 10。将策略从 FIFO 更改为 LRU,并将其更改为 OPT。计算所述地址追踪中的每个访问是否命中或未命中。

## Problem2

### 问题描述

对于大小为 5 的高速缓存，为以下每个策略生成最差情况的地址引用序列：FIFO、LRU 和 MRU(最差情况下的引用序列导致尽可能多的未命中）。对于最差情况下的引用序列，需要的缓存增大多少，才能大幅提高性能，并接近 OPT?

### 问题分析

FIFO和LRU在循环工作负载中达到最差情况，MRU在交替引用两个页面时达到最差情况。

### 问题解答

**对于最差情况下的引用序列，需要缓存增大到与页面数相同，才能大幅提高性能，并接近 OPT。**

## Problem3

### 问题描述

生成一个随机追踪序列（使用 Python 或 Perl)。你预计不同的策略在这样的追踪序列上的表现如何？

### 问题分析

FIFO：非常简单的替换策略，先进先出。  
LRU：换出最近最少使用的页。  
OPT：替换最远的将来会访问的页，命中率是所有策略中最高的。  
UNOPT：替换最近的将来会访问的页，命中率是所有策略中最低的。  
RAND：完全看运气，可能会非常幸运，也可能非常不幸。  
CLOCK：近似LRU，命中率应不超过LRU，且clockbits越多，命中率越高。

## Problem4

### 问题描述

现在生成一些局部性追踪序列。如何能够产生这样的追踪序列？LRU 表现如何？RAND 比 LRU 好多少？CLOCK 表现如何？CLOCK 使用不同数量的时钟位，表现如何？

### 问题解答

#### tool.py

```py
import random
import sys

numAddr = 10

# 空间局部性
def generate_spatial_locality_trace():
    trace = [random.randint(0, numAddr)]
    for i in range(8):
        l = trace[-1]
        rand = [l, (l + 1) % numAddr, (l - 1) % numAddr, random.randint(0, numAddr)]
        trace.append(random.choice(rand))
    # 问题给的paging-policy.py -a参数里, 逗号后不能空格,因此拼接再打印
    print(','.join([str(i) for i in trace]))

# 时间局部性
def generate_temporal_locality_trace():
    trace = [random.randint(0, numAddr)]
    for i in range(8):
        rand = [random.randint(0, numAddr), random.choice(trace)]
        trace.append(random.choice(rand))
    print(','.join([str(i) for i in trace]))

if len(sys.argv) != 1:
    if sys.argv[1] == '-t':
        generate_temporal_locality_trace()
    elif sys.argv[1] == '-s':
        generate_spatial_locality_trace()
```

**用法：**

```shell
> python3 tool.py -s #产生具有空间局部性的序列
> python3 tool.py -t #产生具有时间局部性的序列
```

#### LRU

```shell
> python2 paging-policy.py -p LRU -c -a  $(python3 tool.py -t)

ARG numaddrs 10
ARG policy LRU
ARG clockbits 2
ARG cachesize 3
ARG maxpage 10
ARG seed 0
ARG notrace False

Solving...

Access: 6  MISS LRU ->          [6] <- MRU Replaced:- [Hits:0 Misses:1]
Access: 5  MISS LRU ->       [6, 5] <- MRU Replaced:- [Hits:0 Misses:2]

Access: 3  MISS LRU ->   [10, 6, 3] <- MRU Replaced:5 [Hits:3 Misses:6]

FINALSTATS hits 3   misses 6   hitrate 33.33

**由上可知，LRU在处理具有时间局部性的追踪序列时表现较好。**

**RAND完全看运气，可能会非常幸运，也可能非常不幸。本例中时间局部性序列命中率等于LRU,空间局部性序列命中率高于LRU。**
